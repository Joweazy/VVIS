            <p class="card-text mb-5">Welcome to Vlak voordat ik sterf (translation: Moments Before I Die) — a Spotify playlist with over 5,000 tracks.
Started in 2018 by four Dutch friends, this playlist has quietly grown into a soundtrack of moments — songs discovered, shared, and revisited over the years. It drifts between eras, from the haunting tones of The Smiths and Joy Division to the modern echoes of John Maus, Fleet Foxes, and Interpol. Well-known voices blend with the most hidden corners of indie music, each track chosen for the feeling it leaves behind. Step in, take your time, and lose yourself in the sound of everything that lingers just before the silence.</p>
